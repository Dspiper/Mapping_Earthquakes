# Mapping_Earthquakes

Use Leaflet.js API to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.

In the challenge, we created a map overlay to show the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth. Also, we added an additional overlay to see all the earthquakes from the last week with a magnitude greater than 4.5 and added a dark view map style.
